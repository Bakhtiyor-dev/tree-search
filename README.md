## Usage:
###### !!! First you need to install cors disabling extension on your browser
Chrome: [Allow CORS: Access-Control-Allow-Origin](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/allow-cors-access-control/lhobafahddgcelffkeicbaginigeejlf "Allow CORS: Access-Control-Allow-Origin")
Firefox: [Allow CORS: Access-Control-Allow-Origin](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/access-control-allow-origin/ "Allow CORS: Access-Control-Allow-Origin")

------------


This is because the API(https://my-api.planet.org)  ***does not provide Access-Control-Allow-Origin*** header for GET requests.  
To get information about Tree you need to provide **image url** which has been uploaded to hosting.
You can get information about tree's name, Scientific name, Genus and Family.
